## Problem Statement
**Expense Management System (Ex e s Man en)**  
Companies often struggle with manual expense reimbursement processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack transparency.  

There is no simple way to:
- Define approval flows based on thresholds.  
- Manage multi-level approvals.  
- Support flexible approval rules.  

---

## Core Features

### 🔐 Authentication & User Management
- On first login/signup:  
  - A new **Company** (with the environment-selected country’s currency) and **Admin User** are auto-created.  
- **Admin Capabilities:**  
  - Create Employees & Managers.  
  - Assign and change roles → Employee, Manager.  
  - Define manager relationships for employees.  

### 🧾 Expense Submission (Employee Role)
Employees can:  
- Submit expense claims (Amount [can be different from company’s currency], Category, Description, Date).  
- View their expense history (Approved, Rejected).  

### ✅ Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin Role)
- Expense is first approved by the assigned manager if **IS MANAGER APPROVER** field is checked.  
- When multiple approvers are assigned, Admin can define their sequence.  

**Example Workflow:**  
1. Manager →  
2. Finance →  
3. Director  

- Expense moves to the next approver only after the current one approves/rejects.  

**Managers can:**  
- View expenses waiting for approval.  
- Approve/Reject with comments.  

### ⚖️ Conditional Approval Flow
Approval rules supported:  
- **Percentage Rule** → If 60% of approvers approve → Expense approved.  
- **Specific Approver Rule** → If CFO approves → Expense auto-approved.  
- **Hybrid Rule** → Combination of percentage and specific approver rule.  

Multiple approvers + Conditional rules can work together.

## 📷 Additional Features
- **OCR for Receipts:**  
  Employees can scan a receipt, and using OCR the expense gets autogenerated with fields like amount, date, description, type, and merchant name.
